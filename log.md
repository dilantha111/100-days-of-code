<!--# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 0: June 02, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Made the Use case diagrams and Basic ER diagrams for a community web application where people post jobs for others. So others can view them and apply for them.

**Thoughts:** It's not coding but hours of planing makes better codings. I think. :) 

### Day 1: June 03, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Normalized the ER Diagram further. And set up the development enviornment. Laravel. And initialized the git repo.

**Thoughts:** well I think I should commit more than one hour for this. But I am counting without the time I use to learn the necessary things for this project.
